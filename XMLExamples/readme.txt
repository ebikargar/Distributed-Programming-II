it.polito.dp2.xml     		DOM tree graphical viewer and Dom tree traversing sample
it.polito.dp2.xml.parse   	Examples of DOM parsers implemented with JAXP
it.polito.dp2.xml.library 	Example of XML element loading into Java objects (DOM and JAXB)
it.polito.dp2.xml.fibonacci	Example of creation and serialization of a DOM tree

General information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All the samples found here refer to libraries that are available in the
standard java distribution.
They have been tested with JDK 1.7.0_40 and JDK 1.8.0_91.
Note that, when changing the java distribution, message reporting may be
different, because the xml parser changes.
All the examples can be compiled by the default ant task, by just typing
ant


DOM tree graphical viewer
=========================
DomEcho02.java  is a program that shows the DOM tree of an xml file
                whose name is passed on the command line.
                Useful to explore the structure of DOM trees graphically.

DOM parser programming with JAXP
================================
DomParseS.java   Non-validating simple parser (generic error reporting)
DomParse.java    Non-validating parser with complete error reporting 
                 (no warning reporting)
DomParseV.java   Dtd validating parser with error reporting and warning reporting
DomParseVNS.java Dtd validating parser as before, but namespace aware
DomParseVS.java	 W3C schema validating parser with error reporting and warning reporting

Under examples, various xml file samples can be found, with and without errors.

DOM tree traversing
===================
DomWalker.java  traverses the DOM tree of an xml file whose name is passed
		as command line argument and prints its structure.

DOM XML element loading into Java objects (package it.polito.dp2.xml.library)
=========================================
DomLibrary.java 	loads the elements of an xml file (whose name is passed as
			command line argument) having the "book" tag into java
			objects of the Book class (a sample xml file is book.xml).
DomLibrary_dtd.java	version that uses dtd validated xml files (like book_dtd.xml)

DOM tree creation and serialization (package it.polito.dp2.xml.fibonacci)
===================================
DomFibonacci.java       creates an xml file containing the first 25
			numbers of the Fibonacci series.
DomIntSerializer.java   is a generic serializer for an xml file of integers
Fibonacci.java          Fibonacci number generator (used by the programs above)

JAXB XML element loading into Java objects (package it.polito.dp2.xml.library)
==========================================
JAXBLibrary.java	JAXB version of the library program that uses the classes
			generated from the schema books.xsd.
			Code can be generated by running the default ant task.
			This version validates the input xml file against the
			books.xsd schema (use books_schema.xml as a sample).
JAXBLibraryA.java	JAXB version of the library program that uses hand-annotated
			classes (in package it.polito.dp2.xml.library.annotated)
			Before running this example, it is necessary to generate
			the schema from the annotated classes in the annotated package
			This can be done by running
			ant schemagen
