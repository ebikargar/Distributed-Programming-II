In this document I declared details of my designed pattern for DTD part of assignment1a.

I considered nffgVerifier as the root element.
-Inside each root element we can have one or more nffg elements.
--Each nffg element is the sequence of 3 elements: nodes-links-policies
---Each nodes element composed of one or more node element.
---Each links element composed of one or more link element.
---Each policies element is either reachability or traversal element.
