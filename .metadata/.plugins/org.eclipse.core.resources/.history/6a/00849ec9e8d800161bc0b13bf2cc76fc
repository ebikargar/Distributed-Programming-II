In this document I declared details of my designed pattern for DTD part of assignment1a.

some consideration inside my design:
- Each NF-FG is characterized by a name, which uniquely identifies it in the the root element.
-A generic policy ( reachability | traversal )  is characterized by a name, which uniquely identifies it inside the root element.
-Each node has a name, which is unique within the NF-FG.
-Each link has a name, which is unique within the NF-FG.
