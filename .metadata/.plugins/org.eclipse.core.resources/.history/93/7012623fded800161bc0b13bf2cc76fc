In this document I declared details of my designed pattern for DTD part of assignment1a.

I considered nffgVerifier as the root element.
-Inside each root element we can have one or more nffg elements.
--Each nffg element is the sequence of 3 elements: nodes-links-policies.nffg has it's name as a unique ID and update time as it's attributes.
---Each nodes element composed of one or more node element.
---Each links element composed of one or more link element.
---Each policies element composed of one or more policy element.

----Each node element contains provider catalogue .Node has it's name (unique ID) as it's attribute.  
-----providerCat is an empty element with enumeration of function type as it's attribute.

----Each link element has it's name(unique ID) plus source and destination node as it's attributes.
-----srcNode & destNode are reference to one of the node in node element.(they can also be consider as element inside the link but for having a better design I considered them as attributes here).

----Each policy element is either reachability or traversal element.policy has it's name(unique ID) as attribute.
-----reachability is an empty element that has : nffgName( referenced to one of the nffg's)-isPositive (TRUE|FALSE)-srcNode(referenced to one of the node)-destNode((referenced to one of the node)-verificationResult(true|false)-verificationTime-verificationMsg as it's attributes.
