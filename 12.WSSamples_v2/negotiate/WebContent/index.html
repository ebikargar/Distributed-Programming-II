<h2>Negotiate RESTful Web Service</h2>
<p>
The negotiate web service is a simple web service showing all the different HTTP
methods in action. The aim of the service is to allow clients to load, read,
unload and modify negotiated objects. A negotiated object is a resource that
includes a range of real numbers (delimited by a minimum and a maximum).
On load or modify, the service negotiates the actual range of the object and
may refuse to complete the operation.
</p>
<p>
The main resource of the service is the collection resource 
named <a href="webapi/negotiateService">negotiateService</a>
which represents the (initially empty) collection of negotiated
objects. By POST-ing to this resource it is possible to create
new negotiated objects as sub-resources. The ids of these resources
are decided by the service.
Resources representing single negotiated objects can be read,
updated and deleted by means of get, put and delete methods.
